The tools can be powered by electricity, fuel (gasoline, coal), air, steam, water, or gunpowder. They are classified according to their common functions  (e.g., boring, cutting, digging, gripping, etc.) If a drill bit, saw blade, or other tool part that produces an injury is attached to a handtool then the entire handtool should be listed as the source, unless the injury was inflicted by an electrical cord. If the part is separate, a code from Division 4 should be selected.",
